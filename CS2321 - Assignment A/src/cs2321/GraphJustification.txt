Graph Justification:
Please explain why you have chosen your particular graph implementation.
KEEP ALL LINES LESS THAN 80 CHARACTERS LONG, or you risk receiving no
credit for this portion.

I chose the AdjListGraph for its balance between overhead and run-time costs.
I optimized the AdjListGraph with the usage of HashMap in InnerVertex,
which slants toward slightly more overhead but slightly better runtime, 
gratified with mostly amortized cost values.
