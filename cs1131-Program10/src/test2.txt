they lack the input from local farmer expertise, a valuable
input that may be in short supply.
In this context, the structure of agriculture reflects these
conditions and affects communities both positively and negatively
through government and non-government agreements
and rules (e.g., buyer or private standards, marketing agreements,
and other criteria shaping local decision making) that
reorder decisionmaking away fromaddressing local needs and
toward more externally focused goals of commodity production.
In this article, I outline a conceptual model demonstrating
the benefits of local environmental and social values (i.e., tradition)
as decision making criteria2 in the conservation of
stream and river resources. Local criteria emerge from communities
based on tradition and local ecological knowledge that
support household and community needs. In contrast, rules and
agreements or other forms of government policy and market
practice can shift the focus away from decisions thatmeet local
social and environmental needs. This occurs as information and
decision making shift to networks of states or corporations,
which are far-removed from local communities and environments
